# PostcodeCrimeChecker
**Project**: Coursework 2 for SysDev ECM1421 Group Programming Exercise

The goal of this project is to create a program to the following spec:
"Each team is required to build a program with multiple Python modules of your own design. 

These modules, and functions within the modules, should be tested independently.

Your program must use a command-line interface to prompt the user for input parameters, display results, and provide user instructions, i.e. help. 

For commands that produce many lines of output your program should prompt the user for a file name, and save the output to that file.

When your program prompts for user input it must always accept the options of Quit and Restart."
